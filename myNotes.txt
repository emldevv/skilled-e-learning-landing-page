Linear gradients and CSS variables
    I have found that I cannot include my custom property variables in the parantheses of a linear gradient function. There is no problem when I include the specific colour references (hexadecimal, hsl etc) and this produces the desired result.

    I reuse the same gradient colour scheme and direction at several points on the site, so it would be convenient to have the gradient as a custom variable. I'm going to play around with it.

    *2 minutes later*
    It works! I transferred the linear gradient function to the custom variable section, and then simply named the variable in the CSS section I wanted to employ it. Nice little discovery.
Shadow on 2nd button
    I must have searched for a full hour just to find a similar example of a shadow being cast foward onto a surfacxe in front of the item. Nothing. I'm sure if I read the articles, set up a sandbox, and tested all different possible paramters I would have eventually discovered it. But I'm trying to get something done here, not becaome the world's second foremost expert on CSS shadow casting. I just went witha standard box shadow.
